# General Project Information
The **CryptoMañana (CryptoManana)** project is a **PHP cryptography framework** that provides object-oriented components and **a full cryptography model**.
The framework is **COMPLETELY FREE** for usage and is published under the **[MIT License](https://github.com/TonyKaravasilev/CryptoManana/blob/master/LICENSE){:target="_blank"}**.
The framework has been created and developed by **[Tony Karavasilev](https://karavasilev.info){:target="_blank"}** both as a personal dream come true and as part of his PhD work.

**This software framework provides a fully functional cryptography model with a vast of cryptography primitives and protocols.**
It is very useful for secure hashing, encryption, key exchange, data signing, random data generation and even more.
The CryptoMañana framework is here to make your development both faster and more secure!

**In addition, the software framework**: 
- Is fully object-oriented and developer-friendly; 
- Follows the PSR-0/PSR-4 autoloading standard; 
- Follows the PSR-12 (includes PSR-1 and extends PSR-2) coding style guide;
- Works under a vast of PHP versions, starting from 5.5 to the latest 7.4; 
- Works under both Windows or Linux based distributions for any PHP web server;
- Has a 100.00% code coverage result via a huge unit test suite;
- Has a 100.00% PHPDoc components coverage for IDE stubs;
- Takes advantage of the Dependency Injection technique; 
- Takes advantage of a set of software design patterns; 
- Applies the S.O.L.I.D design principles; 
- Applies the DRY coding principle; 
- Applies the KISS design principle.
