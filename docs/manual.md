### [](#general-project-information){:.book_mark}General Project Information ###

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The **CryptoMa単ana (CryptoManana)** project is a **PHP cryptography framework** that provides a
huge amount of object-oriented security-based components and **a full cryptography model** implementation. The framework
is **COMPLETELY FREE** for usage and is published under
the **[MIT License](https://github.com/TonyKaravasilev/CryptoManana/blob/master/LICENSE){:target="_blank"}**. The
framework has been created and developed by **[Tony Karavasilev](https://karavasilev.info){:target="_blank"}** both as a
personal dream come true and as part of his PhD work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**This software framework provides a fully functional cryptography model with a vast amount of
cryptography primitives, protocols and services.** The integration of the framework in a software project makes the
implementation of the best cybersecurity principles easier and faster to achieve. It comes in handy when a professional
software engineer needs to develop secure application features, which may include the need of:

- Integrity checking;
- Secure comparison;
- Source authentication;
- Key generation;
- Key derivation;
- Password hashing;
- Identification;
- Authentication;
- Authorization;
- Encrypted storage;
- Encrypted communication;
- Authenticated encryption;
- End-to-end encryption;
- Key exchanging over an insecure channel;
- Cross-site request forgery protection;
- Data signing and verification;
- Transparent data encryption;
- Full-disk encryption;
- Secure data generation;
- Secure data shuffling;
- Secure data erasure;
- Others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The CryptoMa単ana framework** is here to make your development **both faster and more secure!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In addition, the software framework**:

- Includes a vast range of algorithms, standards and cryptography services;
- Includes a full cryptography model for PHP;
- Unicode encoding information processing support;
- A small footprint with practically zero dependencies;
- Is fully object-oriented and developer-friendly;
- Follows the PSR-0/PSR-4 autoloading standard;
- Follows the PSR-12 (includes PSR-1 and extends PSR-2) coding style guide;
- Works under a vast of PHP versions, starting from 5.5 to the latest 8.0 (x86/x64);
- Works under both Windows or Unix/Linux based distributions for any PHP web server;
- Has a 100.00% code coverage result via a huge unit test suite under every supported version;
- Has a 100.00% PHPDoc components coverage for a full IDE stubs autocompletion;
- Takes advantage of the Dependency Injection technique;
- Takes advantage of a set of software design patterns;
- Applies the S.O.L.I.D design principles;
- Applies the DRY coding principle;
- Applies the KISS design principle;
- Developer-friendly documentation.
